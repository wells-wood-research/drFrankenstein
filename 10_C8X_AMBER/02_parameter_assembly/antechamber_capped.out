Welcome to antechamber 22.0: molecular input file processor.

Info: acdoctor mode is on: check and diagnose problems in the input file.
Info: The atom type is set to gaff2; the options available to the -at flag are
      gaff, gaff2, amber, bcc, and sybyl.

Warning: Unusual element (Pd) for atom (ID: 33, Name: Pd).
/home/esp/anaconda3/envs/Igor/bin/wrapped_progs/antechamber: Fatal Error!
GAFF does not have sufficient parameters for molecules having unusual
       elements (those other than H,C,N,O,S,P and halogens).
       To ensure antechamber works properly, one may need to designate
       bond types for bonds involved with unusual elements.
       To do so, simply freeze the bond types by appending "F" or "f" 
       to the corresponding bond types in ac or mol2 files
       and rerun antechamber without unusual element checking via:
       antechamber -dr no 
       Alternatively for metals, see metalpdb2mol2.py in MCPB.
