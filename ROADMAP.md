# AMBER COMPATABILITY 
[x] add wildcards to acccount for weird capping groups
    [x] make atomType map using PRMTOP
[x] in the case of re-parameterised Phi/Psi, add extra params to account for ncAA-ncAA interactions

# Efficiency
1. problem with df merging in stitching assistant [??]
2. gif creation is too slow (do we turn it off or skip frames?)


# debugging
[x] yaml writing after stitching
2. issues with time gantt chart
    [] check how torsion scanning timing is implemented
